# cloud computing overview - 22 jan
It is providing computing services like servers,storage,databases,networking,software,analytics,intellegence over the internet.
# AWS(Amazon web services)
They are one of the top service providers,services they provide are:
- computing services
- storage services
- network services,etc
# Their famous services are like
- EC2(Elastic Computing Cloud) - we can deploy our application in the EC2, it provides a compute instances to the application in the cloud
- S3(simple storage service) - used to store any amount of data and retrive it any any part of web. data are stored as object in the buckets
- RDS(Relational database service) - used to set up operate and scale a relational database. We can choose our own database engines like postgresql,mysql etc.
- Cloudtrail - is used to continously monitor the activity of our AWS account, it is tool for security for making aws account an secured one
- Cloud Watch - it is a monitoring and managing services that helps us to gain visibility to our AWS account and troubleshoot issues
- Lambda - serverless network runs for only 15 minutes,once time completed the particular instance will be terminated
# GIT overview -20 jan
- Git stands for Global information tracking
- GIT is a website/cloud based services that is used by developers to manage and store their works and resources.
- It is called version because it helps to keep track and control the previous works
- whenever changes need to be done clone your file/code from main to your own branch and then complete it
- Once the changes are completed and checked then push it to the main/master
# Terminologies of GIT 18 jan
# repository
- It acts like a project folder
- Contains all project related codes and files
- It also has the history of changes made by all
- Every project has distinct repositories , we can create when we need a new project.
# Main branch
- It is one of the branch in the repository but all works will be available there
- once the changes are made those details will be pushed to the main branch from other branch
# Branch
- It is used to clone the works from main branch and to make some changes over there
- we can create our own branch and make our own changes over there,once changes are done tey can be pushed to the main branch
# pull request
- once we do some changes in the code cloned from main we should raise pull request for that 
- once all accept and approve our changes we should push that to the main branch
# push
- It is used to push the commits from the local to remote repository
# commit changes
- Is adding our changes to the file or keeping track of it
- Those are the changes we make to our codes or source files
- "commit changes" refers to the process of saving your changes to a Git repository.
- Git is a version control system that allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. 
- When you make changes to your project, you need to commit those changes to the Git repository
to track the modifications and make them part of the project's history.
# local repository
- It is the place where we do our individual development changes we need to make and everthing
# Remote repository
- It is the place where all works on collaboration and a shared space of work
- once we do changes in local repository we can commit those changes and push it it remote repository
# infrastructure Overview
- servers -> It is a place to store our data and retrive whenever needed
- S3 -> These are the storage service that has the storage buckets where data can be stored
- Lambda overview -> These are the serverless one in which AWS takes care of its infrasturucture
- No need to provision or manage servers,they autoamtically update and runs once the code is uploaded.
