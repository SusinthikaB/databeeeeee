*repository* 
It acts like a project folder
Contains all project related codes and files
It also has the history of changes made by all
Every project has distinct repositories , we can create when we need a new project.
*Main branch*
It is one of the branch in the repository but all works will be available there
once the changes are made those details will be pushed to the main branch from other branch
*Branch*
It is used to clone the works from main branch and to make some changes over there
we can create our own branch and make our own changes over there,once changes are done tey can be pushed to the main branch
*pull request*
once we do some changes in the code cloned from main we should raise pull request for that 
once all accept and approve our changes we should push that to the main branch
