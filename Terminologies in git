*repository* 
It acts like a project folder
Contains all project related codes and files
It also has the history of changes made by all
Every project has distinct repositories , we can create when we need a new project.
*Main branch*
It is one of the branch in the repository but all works will be available there
once the changes are made those details will be pushed to the main branch from other branch
*Branch*
It is used to clone the works from main branch and to make some changes over there
we can create our own branch and make our own changes over there,once changes are done tey can be pushed to the main branch
*pull request*
once we do some changes in the code cloned from main we should raise pull request for that 
once all accept and approve our changes we should push that to the main branch
*push*
it is used to push the commits from the local to remote repository
*commit changes*
Is adding our changes to the file or keeping track of it
Those are the changes we make to our codes or source files
// "commit changes" refers to the process of saving your changes to a Git repository.
Git is a version control system that allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously. 
When you make changes to your project, you need to commit those changes to the Git repository
to track the modifications and make them part of the project's history.//
*local repository*
it is the place where we do our individual development changes we need to make and everthing
*Remote repository*
it is the place where all works on collaboration and a shared space of work
once we do changes in local repository we can commit those changes and push it it remote repository
