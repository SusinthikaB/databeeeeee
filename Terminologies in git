*repository* 
It acts like a project folder
Contains all project related codes and files
It also has the history of changes made by all
Every project has distinct repositories , we can create when we need a new project.
*Main branch*
It is one of the branch in the repository but all works will be available there
once the changes are made those details will be pushed to the main branch from other branch
